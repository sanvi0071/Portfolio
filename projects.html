                    <h2>Potato Disease Classification</h2>
                    <p>This project focuses on building a deep learning model to accurately classify potato leaf diseases using image data.
                    The system helps in early detection and diagnosis of diseases such as late blight, early blight, and healthy leaves,
                    aiding farmers in timely and effective crop management. The model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze leaf
                    images and provides actionable insights to improve crop health and yield.</p>
